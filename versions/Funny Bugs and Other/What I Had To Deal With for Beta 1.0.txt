//Fix double speed on mobs
//When loading/restarting
//Moving platforms - that was the hardest thing ever.
//-Jump velocities reset now once you land on a platform.
//When player two is dead, don't change direction
//Heart2
//When switching between Single Player and Multiplayer, fix translation
//Fix the transparent dirt tiles
//Random counter starter (so the animations are not in sync with each other).
//Ball 2
//Different Controls (Maybe have an array for the keys rather than just keys like up[0] instead of just up).

//Fix restart when one of the players die (reset the health)
//-Didn't test yet, but implemented.

//-If second player dies but first player makes it to the end of the level, second player should have one health next level.
-Change help text eventually because it's not really relevant for multiplayer
If player 2 gets too far away, tp back to first player.
//Fix flying bug.
//-Fix dayTime logic.
//-Fix ball noises.
//-Fix new game.
-Figure out what's tanking the FPS.
