-Customizable Costumes
	-Might need to change the parameters on update for player so it renders another object on top of the player like a hat that also animates
-Need more enemies - based on nature
	-Maybe an enemy with its own projectile
-Add a boss with boss level mechanics (Should take at least 1 week)
	-First boss will be a fight boss: screen will lock onto stage
	-Another boss will be a chase boss: will chase you back to the beginning of the level
//-Change the level load delay ish to just pressing and releasing key
-Add some birds (have weird AI: land on the ground, and then fly up)
///-Animate clouds so they explode when the energy ball hits it
//-Make clouds not look like dongs
-Add sound effects in the game for actions done
-Melee animations (Ask Ray for help)
-Different textures for different themes
	-Maybe tell stories in between theme changes
-Make a menu screen:
	-Choose singleplayer/multiplayer
	-Settings: 
		//-Choose music on or off
		-If really tryhard, you can change keybindings
	-When you click, don't change the menu state until mouse released within the originally clicked box
		//-When box is clicked, change the box to show that the box is clicked
	//-Have help that shows all the controls
-Multiplayer: //SUPER LATE
	-Can 1v1 each other
	-Completely new story mode

//-Blur effect (Gaussian) for pause/game over

//-Make theme of the game day/night depending on the time of day
-Add dialogue with NPC's (smaller text)
	-Will help to develop the story
-Add a shop maybe where you could get stuff
	-Subtracts from your score, but then you obtain stuff!
-Add more stuff in the background for more parallax effect
-Add a sun/moon in the sky
//-Make secret walls transparent when Player makes contact with them (blink on and off every update)

OTHER IDEAS
-Random textures
-Underground theme:
    -Mushrooms
-Underground mushroom stuff
-Different types of rock (hang from ceilings and stuff)
-Ray: Stalagknight...?
-Background has some giant mushrooms
-Boss should be a mushroom wizard
    -When dead: "No, I was just trying to protect my mushroom village."
-Walk past mushroom village, escape village and go to quest hub.

-Forest, rock, desert, ice, graveyard, hell

-Kaley: put a princess in the game.
-RJ: PLOT TO THEME LEVELS AROUND
-Chloe: Enemy that shoots.



-GOAL (Maybe): Turn this game into an RPG.
	-Makes it unique: a 2D Platformer RPG
