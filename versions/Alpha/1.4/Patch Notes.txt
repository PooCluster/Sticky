-Added animations to the title screen.
-Added system where you can load/save when the file does not exist.
-Fixed loading in Survival Mode.
	-The counter resets.
-Fixed/Implemented Blinking Animations!
	-Slimey Joe and Pedaller blink now for one second after they are hurt (blink for one second).
	-The player doesn't randomly disappear for a second after blinking now (blink for two seconds).
-Fixed jumping in the air.
	-It's like double jumping, but without the second jump (would be too generic)
	-Would help for different level designs.
-Fixed Joe's death sound.
	-It used to not play every once in a while.
-Fixed left + right + jump.
-Fixed when you press both left and right, direction doesn't change.
	-This is so Sticky's not always facing right.
-Made the energy ball go faster.
-Made menu clicking way more satisfying.
	-It waits for you to release your mouse click before you go to that menu state.
	-Also, if you release your mouse click outside the previously selected box, no action is registered.
