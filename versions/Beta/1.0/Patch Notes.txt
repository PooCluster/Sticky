Version 1.0 Beta
-Added the text back in the home level.
-Added energy ball sound effects!
-Added a camera class.
	-Save a lot of lines checking boundaries, because now I only have to check once.
	-The camera can now lock both vertically and horizontally simultaneously.
		-This would be useful for pitfalls at the end of levels.
-Added local multiplayer!
	-A second set of hearts are added.
	-The players share the score.
	-The camera is focused on the first player.
	-Second player controls:
		-Arrow keys for moving.
		-"," for sprinting.
		-"." for attack.
	-If the second player dies, but the first player finishes the level, the second player will start the next level with one heart.
	-Rewrote a lot of code just so multiplayer would function.
		-Changed the menu layout.
		-Changed the help code again.
			-Instead of treating each of the help texts as separate, I now treat them all as part of the same array.
			-Reduces the amount of objects I made that had to deal with for help.
			-There is help text for player 2.
		-Changed moving platform code for when player is on (so there can be two players on it independently).
	-The second player's animation counter is offset the first player so their animations are not in sync and makes the game look more natural.
	-If the second player goes too far from the first player, the second player will teleport to player one's position in the same state that player one is in.
	-Camera focuses on the second player if the first player dies.
-Fixed jumping on moving platforms.
	-Jump velocities now reset as soon as a player connects with a platform.

	-This has been claimed before, but it is legitimately fixed this time.
-Fixed Joe death sounds.
	-Sometimes it didn't play.
-Changed rendering system for optimizations.
-Organized the resource files more (moved files around and renamed multiple files).
