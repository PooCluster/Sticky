Version 1.1 Beta
-Added clouds back in; accidentally voided them in the rendering process.
	-Clouds now deal with their own positioning within each level, so I don't have to think about them.
-Added more music into the game; my friend wanted to write some music for me.
	-For the title screen, map selection, and game over screen.
-Added a score counter for anything that changes the score.
	-It can also show when the player gets hurt.
-Added momentum.
	-Momentum only applies when sprinting.
	-Maximum speed is faster than sprinting speed in previous verions.
	-The momentum gets cancelled when colliding with a wall.
	-The only way to gain speed through sprinting is when the player is on some surface.
		-The player cannot gain speed in the air, only maintain it.
	-When sprint is let go, the player will slow down until stopped.
		-The momentum can be cancelled by moving in the opposite direction after letting go of sprint.
	-Energy Ball is also affected by the speed at which the player is going.
-Added a class called GameStateManager which introduces the idea of different game states in the game.
	-Title Screen State
		-Basically the level state, but with a uncloseable menu and a logo of Sticky.
	-Map Level Selection State
		-A new part of the game design that helps the player visualize the progress of the game.
	-Level State
		-This is what the previous versions always had.
-Improved the menu system again.
	-Added a button class.
		-Reduces hard coding, and makes the menu more modular.
		-The buttons can be anywhere on the screen.
		-One button unit can have multiple outlines for boxing the text.
	-Different menu options for the different game states.
	-Menu is now equivalent to pause, except in the Title Screen State.
	-The player is now allowed to change controls!
		-Text I still need to add (it will glitch if trying to change to it): ` ; [ ] \
-Improved multiplayer experience.
	-The Camera class now focuses on both players instead of player one (felt unfair priority).
	-If the players get far enough from each other, split screen!
		-The leftmost player will always be on the left.
		-The rightmost player will always be on the right.
-Improved rendering (other than split screen mode).
	-The menu, hearts, and score all now render independently of player one's position.
-Improved the loading/saving feature.
	-It stores name, levels completed, health, score, and the preferred controls of the players.
	-There are now 3 different load/save slots.
	-The slots can be named.
	-There is overriding logic.
-Organized the code extremely.
	-The main class went from 905 lines to 121 lines of code.
	-Converted all entity arrays into ArrayList (an object that handles arrays).
	-Changed level names so all of them are numerically based.
-Removed Survival Mode.
-Removed help texts.
	-Unnecessary now that the controls can be figured out within the menu.
